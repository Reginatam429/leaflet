# 🌿 Leaflet

Leaflet is a Django-powered plant care tracker that helps you grow your personal indoor jungle. Whether you're managing a windowsill herb garden or a living room full of greenery, Leaflet makes it easy to track your plants, learn about their care needs, and keep a wishlist of species you want to bring home.
